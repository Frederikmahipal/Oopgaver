Inheritance is when a new class is derived from another class. 
It is called subclassed when a class is derived from another class, and the class its derived from is a superclass.
Fx. If you have a class called ‘Vehicles’ (superclass) with a method which prints the sound of a vehicles when its driving. Then you have subclasses called ‘Bike’, ‘Cars’ and ‘bicycle’, which doesn’t sound the same, we are able extend the superclass and override the method for each vehicle so it fits the correct kind of vehicle.
